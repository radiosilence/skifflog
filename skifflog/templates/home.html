            <h1>Keeping track of time is annoying.</h1>
            <p>And time flies when you're having fun at The Skiff!</p>

            <p>For mates with limited plans, there's a function to round their logs "up"
            within a day, in order to spread hours a little more generously. However,
            the default rounding is set to 24 hours to represent that a day is a day.</p>

            <p>Because the rounding only affects the total time spent within a day, one is
            able to log multiple entries in a day and have that count as a single day.</p>

            <p>Logins are handled via Mozilla Persona, as per the who.theskiff.org site.</p>

            <p>Time is saved between sessions, so if you close your browser or reboot,
            the site assumes you are still active.</p>

            <p>In future there will be the ability to delete or amend time slots in the case
            of forgetting to "sign out".</p>
